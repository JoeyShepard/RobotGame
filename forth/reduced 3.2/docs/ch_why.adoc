[quote, Charles H. Moore, redgate Hub 2009] 
Forth is well suited to resource-constrained situations. It doesn't need lots
of memory and doesn't have much overhead. <<CHM1>>

=== The Big Picture

This section provides background information on Forth, the 6502 processor, and
why anybody would want to combine the two. It can be skipped if you already know
all those things.

==== The 6502 CPU

It is a well-established fact that humanity reached the apex of processor design
with the 6502(((6502))) in 1976.

Created by a team including Chuck Peddle((("Peddle, Chuck"))) and Bill
Mensch((("Mensch, Bill"))), it was the engine that powered the 8-bit home
computer revolution of the 1980s.footnote:[Rumor has it that there was another
MPU called "Z80",(((Z80))) but it ended up being a mere footnote.] The
VIC-20(((VIC-20))), Commodore PET(((Commodore PET))), Apple II(((Apple II))),
and Atari 800(((Atari 800))) all used the 6502, among others.

More than 40 years later, the processor is still in production by the
http://www.westerndesigncenter.com/wdc/w65c02s-chip.cfm[Western Design
Center](((WDC))). Apart from commercial uses, there is an active hobbyist scene
centered on the website http://6502.org/[6502.org].(((6502.org))) A
number of people have built their own 8-bit computers based on this chip and
the instructions there, including a
http://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer/[primer] by Garth Wilson((("Wilson,
Garth"))). It is for these systems that Tali Forth 2 was created.

The most important variant of the 6502 produced today is the 
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WDC\_65C02[65c02](((65c02))), a CMOS chip with
some additional instructions. It is for this chip that Tali Forth 2 was written.

But why program in 8-bit assembler at all? The 65c02 is fun to work with
because of its clean instruction set architecture (ISA)(((instruction set
architecture (ISA) ))) This is not the place to explain the joys of assembler.
The official handbook for the 65c02 is _Programming the 65816_ <<EnL>>.

TIP: Garth  Wilson((("Wilson, Garth))) answers this question in greater
detail as part of his 6502 primer at http://wilsonminesco.com/6502primer/ .

=== Forth 

[quote, Elliot Williams, Forth: The Hacker's language]
If C gives you enough rope to hang yourself, Forth is a flamethrower crawling with
cobras. <<EW>>

Forth(((Forth))) is the _enfant terrible_ of programming languages. It was
invented by Charles "Chuck" H. Moore((("Moore, Charles"))) in the 1960s to do
work with radio astronomy, way before there were modern operating systems or
programming languages.

TIP: A brief history of Forth can be found at
https://www.forth.com/resources/forth-programming-language 

As a language for people who actually need to get things done, it lets you run
with scissors, play with fire, and cut corners until you've turned a square
into a circle. Forth is not for the faint-hearted: It is trivial, for
instance, to redefine `1` as `2` and `true` as `false`. Though you can do really,
really clever things with few lines of code, the result can be hard for other
people to understand, leading to the reputation of Forth begin a "write-only
language". However, Forth excels when you positively, absolutely have to get
something done with hardware that is really too weak for the job.

It should be no surprise that NASA(((NASA))) is one of the organizations that
uses Forth. The _Cassini_ mission(((Cassini))) to Saturn used a
http://www.cpushack.com/2013/02/21/charles-moore-forth-stack-processors/[Forth
CPU], for instance. It is also perfect for small computers like the 8-bit
65c02. After a small boom in the 1980s, more powerful computers led to a
decline of the language. The "Internet of Things" (IOT) (((Internet of
Things))) with embedded small processors has led to a certain amount of
https://www.embedded.com/design/programming-languages-and-tools/4431133/Go-Forth-[renewed
interest] in the language. It helps that Forth is easy to implement: It is
stack-based, uses Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)(((Reverse Polish Notation)))
and a simple threaded(((threading))) interpreter model.

There is no way this document can provide an adequate introduction to Forth.
There are quite a number of tutorials, however, such as _A Beginner's Guide to
Forth_ by J.V. Nobel ((("Nobel, J.V.")))<<JVN>> or the classic (but slightly
dated) _Starting Forth_ by Leo Brodie.((("Brodie, Leo")))<<LB1>>
Gforth,(((Gforth))) one of the more powerful free Forths, comes with its own
http://www.complang.tuwien.ac.at/forth/gforth/Docs-html/Tutorial.html[tutorial].

TIP: Once you have understood the basics of the language, do yourself a favor
and read _Thinking Forth_ by Brodie((("Brodie, Leo")))<<LB2>> which deals with
the philosophy of the language. Even if you never code a line of Forth in your
life, exposure to Forth will change the way you think about programming, much
like Lisp(((Lisp))).

=== Writing Your Own Forth

Even if the 65c02 is great and Forth is brilliant, why go to the effort of
writing a new, bare-metal version of the languages? After almost 50 years,
shouldn't there be a bunch of Forths around already?

==== FIG Forth

In fact, the classic Forth available for the whole group of 8-bit MPUs is FIG
Forth(((FIG Forth))). "FIG" stands for "Forth Interest Group". Ported to various
architectures, it was original based on an incarnation for the 6502 written by
Bill Ragsdale((("Ragsdale, Bill))) and Robert Selzer((("Selzer, Robert"))).
There are PDFs of the http://www.forth.org/fig-forth/fig-forth\_6502.pdf[6502
version] from September 1980 freely available -- there is a tradition of placing
Forth in the public domain -- and more than one hobbyist has revised it to his
machine.

However, Forth has changed a lot in the past three decades. There is now a
standardized version called https://forth-standard.org/[ANS Forth], which
includes very basic changes such as how the `do` loop works. Learning the
language with FIG Forth is like learning English with _The Canterbury
Tales_.((("Canterbury Tales, The")))

==== A Modern Forth for the 65c02

Tali Forth was created to provide an easy to understand modern Forth written
especially for the 65c02 that anybody can understand, adapt to their own use,
and maybe actually work with. As part of that effort, the source code is heavily
commented and this document tries to explain the internals in more detail.
