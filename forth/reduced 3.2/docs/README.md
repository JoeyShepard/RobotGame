# Documentation for Tali Forth 2 
Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>

Tali Forth's documentation is written in AsciiDoc and compiled to other versions
with the following commands: 

- HTML: `asciidoctor -a toc=left manual.adoc`
- PDF:  `asciidoctor-pdf -v manual.adoc`

Converting to GitHub's markdown is tricker than you would think. There is an
experimental script included in this folder, `asciidoc_to_markdown.sh`, that
however eats the title line for some reason. This must be added by hand at
the moment. See https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor/issues/1907

Apart from that, this folder looks messier than it is -- what you are probably
looking for are the `manual.html`, `manual.pdf` and possibly the `WORDLIST.md`
files. There are also the listing files here generated by the Ophis assembler.
