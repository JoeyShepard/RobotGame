Tali Forth would never have been possible without the help of a very large
number of people, very few of whom I have actually met.

First, there is the crew at http://6502.org[6502.org](((6502.org))) who not
only helped me build my own actual, working 6502 computer, but also introduced
me to Forth. Tali would not exist without their inspiration, support, and
feedback.

Special thanks go out to Mike Barry((("Barry, Mike"))) and Lee
Pivonka((("Pivonka, Lee"))), who both suggested vast improvements to the code
in size, structure, and speed. And then there is Sam Colwell((("Colwell, Sam"))) 
who contributed the invaluable test suite and a whole lot of code. 

Thank you, everybody.
