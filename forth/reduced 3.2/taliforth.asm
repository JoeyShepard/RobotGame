; 32 KiB RAM and 32 KiB ROM, but kept here to make the code more useful for
; other hardware configurations

; COMPILE WORDS, JUMPS and SUBROUTINE JUMPS INTO CODE

; These three routines compile instructions such as "jsr xt_words" into a word
; at compile time so they are available at run time. Words that use this
; routine may not be natively compiled. We use "cmpl" as not to confuse these
; routines with the COMPILE, word. Always call this with a subroutine jump.
; This means combining JSR/RTS to JMP in those cases is not going to work. To
; use, load the LSB of the address in A and the MSB in Y. You can remember
; which comes first by thinking of the song "Young Americans" ("YA") by David
; Bowie.

;               lda #<addr      ; LSB   ; "Americans"
;               jsr cmpl_subroutine

; Also, we keep a routine here to compile a single byte passed through A.

; PRINTING ROUTINES

; We distinguish two types of print calls, both of which take the string number
; (see strings.asm) in A:

;       print_string       - with a line feed
;       print_string_no_lf - without a line feed

; In addition, print_common provides a lower-level alternative for error
; handling and anything else that provides the address of the
; zero-terminated string directly in tmp3. All of those routines assume that
; printing should be more concerned with size than speed, because anything to
; do with humans reading text is going to be slow.
