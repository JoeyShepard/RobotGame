% Tests for Forth
% Scot W. Stevenson

Tali Forth 2 comes with a test\index{testing} suite in the \texttt{tests}
folder. It is based on code by John Hayes\index{Hayes, John} and was first
adapted by Sam Colwell\index{Colwell, Sam}. To run it, switch to that folder and
start the \texttt{talitest.py}\index{talitest.py@\texttt{talitest.py}} program
with Python3. The tests can take around half an hour to run and produce a lot of
output, including, at the end, a list of words that didn't work. A detailed list
of results is saved to the file \index{results.txt\texttt{results.txt}} 

\texttt{Talitest.py} requires the
\texttt{pexpect}\index{pexpect@\texttt{pexpect}} package.

(During development, testing was done by hand with a list of words that has
since been placed in the \index{old@\texttt{old}} folder.)
