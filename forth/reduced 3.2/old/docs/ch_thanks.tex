Tali Forth would never have been possible without the help of a very large
number of people, very few of whom I have actually even met.

First, there is the crew at \href{http://6502.org}{6502.org}\index{6502.org} who
not only helped me build a 6502 computer, but also introduced me to Forth. Tali
Forth would not exist without their inspiration, support, and feedback. Thanks,
guys.

Special thanks go out to Mike Barry\index{Barry, Mike} and Lee
Pivonka\index{Pivonka, Lee}, who both suggested vast improvements to the code
in size, structure, and speed.
