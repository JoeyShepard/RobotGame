; MEMORY MAP OF RAM

; Drawing is not only very ugly, but also not to scale. See the manual for 
; details on the memory map. Note that some of the values are hard-coded in
; the testing routines, especially the size of the input history buffer, the
; offset for PAD, and the total RAM size. If these are changed, the tests will
; have to be changed as well

; Default kernel file for Tali Forth 2 
; Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
; First version: 19. Jan 2014
; This version: 18. Feb 2018
;
; This section attempts to isolate the hardware-dependent parts of Tali
; Forth 2 to make it easier for people to port it to their own machines.
; Ideally, you shouldn't have to touch any other files. There are three
; routines and one string that must be present for Tali to run:
;
;       kernel_init - Initialize the low-level hardware
;       kernel_getc - Get single character in A from the keyboard (blocks)
;       kernel_putc - Prints the character in A to the screen
;       s_kernel_id - The zero-terminated string printed at boot
;
; This default version Tali ships with is written for the py65mon machine 
; monitor (see docs/MANUAL.md for details). 

; The main file of Tali got us to $e000. However, py65mon by default puts
; the basic I/O routines at the beginning of $f000. We don't want to change
; that because it would make using it out of the box harder, so we just 
; advance past the virtual hardware addresses.
.advance $f006

; All vectors currently end up in the same place - we restart the system
; hard. If you want to use them on actual hardware, you'll have to redirect
; them all.
