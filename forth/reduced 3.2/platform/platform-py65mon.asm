; I/O facilities are handled in the separate kernel files because of their
; hardware dependencies. See docs/memorymap.txt for a discussion of Tali's
; memory layout.


; MEMORY MAP OF RAM

; Drawing is not only very ugly, but also not to scale. See the manual for
; details on the memory map. Note that some of the values are hard-coded in
; the testing routines, especially the size of the input history buffer, the
; offset for PAD, and the total RAM size. If these are changed, the tests will
; have to be changed as well

; HARD PHYSICAL ADDRESSES

; Some of these are somewhat silly for the 65c02, where for example
; the location of the Zero Page is fixed by hardware. However, we keep
; these for easier comparisons with Liara Forth's structure and to
; help people new to these things.

.alias ram_end   $8000-1        ; end of installed RAM

.alias stack0    $0100          ; begin of Return Stack ($0100-$01ff)
.alias hist_buff ram_end-$03ff  ; begin of history buffers


; SOFT PHYSICAL ADDRESSES

; Tali currently doesn't have separate user variables for multitasking. To
; prepare for this, though, we've already named the location of the user
; variables user0. Note cp0 starts one byte further down so that it currently
; has the address $300 and not $2FF. This avoids crossing the page boundry when
; accessing the user table, which would cost an extra cycle.

; FINALLY

; Of the 32 KiB we use, 24 KiB are reserved for Tali (from $8000 to $DFFF)
; and the last eight (from $E000 to $FFFF) are left for whatever the user
; wants to use them for.

; Default kernel file for Tali Forth 2
; Scot W. Stevenson <scot.stevenson@gmail.com>
; First version: 19. Jan 2014
; This version: 18. Feb 2018
;
; This section attempts to isolate the hardware-dependent parts of Tali
; Forth 2 to make it easier for people to port it to their own machines.
; Ideally, you shouldn't have to touch any other files. There are three
; routines and one string that must be present for Tali to run:
;
;       kernel_init - Initialize the low-level hardware
;       kernel_getc - Get single character in A from the keyboard (blocks)
;       kernel_putc - Prints the character in A to the screen
;       s_kernel_id - The zero-terminated string printed at boot
;
; This default version Tali ships with is written for the py65mon machine
; monitor (see docs/MANUAL.md for details).

; The main file of Tali got us to $e000. However, py65mon by default puts
; the basic I/O routines at the beginning of $f000. We don't want to change
; that because it would make using it out of the box harder, so we just
; advance past the virtual hardware addresses.
.advance $f010

; All vectors currently end up in the same place - we restart the system
; hard. If you want to use them on actual hardware, you'll have to redirect
; them all.
